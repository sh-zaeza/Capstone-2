**[SUB_SOLUTION 1]:** In the passage, touchdowns are scored through passes (e.g., Ben Roethlisberger's 8-yard and 52-yard passes) and runs (e.g., Rashard Mendenhall's 2-yard run), as well as a kickoff return (Joshua Cribbs' 98-yard return).

The Treaty of Brétigny set his ransom at 3 million crowns and allowed for hostages to be held in lieu of John. The hostages included two of his sons, several princes and nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France. While these hostages were held, John returned to France to try and raise funds to pay the ransom. In 1362 John's son Louis of Anjou, a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped captivity.
