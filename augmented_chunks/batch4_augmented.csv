It formally broke away from its overlord Sukhothai in 1330. The southern kingdom's relationship with Sukhothai had always been an opportunistic arrangement from the beginning, designed to secure its rear in case of invasions from Upper Burma. In March 1298, just four years after he became a vassal of Sukhothai, when the Upper Burma ceased to be a threat, Wareru conveniently asked for and received recognition directly from the Mongol emperor as governor even though Sukhothai itself was already a vassal of the Mongols. Indeed, when Sukhothai grew weaker, Martaban seized the Tenasserim coast from Sukhothai in 1319. A decade later, Sukhothai tried to reassert control, reoccupying Tenasserim, and attacking Martaban in 1330. Martaban's defences held. It threw off any formal ties with Sukhothai. Nonetheless, the kingdom remained fragmented into three power centres: the Irrawaddy delta in the west, Pegu in the middle and Martaban in the southeast, each with its own chief, who pledged nominal allegiance to the high king. In 1363, Martaban revolted, and outlasted Pegu's armies. After six years, Pegu gave up.

history_988,f66a7574-4d0c-4eed-bbda-9e5dc141152d,"In the south too, the Mon-speaking kingdom based out of Martaban had slowly come into its own. It formally broke away from its overlord Sukhothai in 1330. The southern kingdom's relationship with Sukhothai had always been an opportunistic arrangement from the beginning, designed to secure its rear in case of invasions from Upper Burma. In March 1298, just four years after he became a vassal of Sukhothai, when the Upper Burma ceased to be a threat, Wareru conveniently asked for and received recognition directly from the Mongol emperor as governor even though Sukhothai itself was already a vassal of the Mongols. Indeed, when Sukhothai grew weaker, Martaban seized the Tenasserim coast from Sukhothai in 1319. A decade later, Sukhothai tried to reassert control, reoccupying Tenasserim, and attacking Martaban in 1330. Martaban's defences held. It threw off any formal ties with Sukhothai. Nonetheless, the kingdom remained fragmented into three power centres: the Irrawaddy delta in the west, Pegu in the middle and Martaban in the southeast, each with its own chief, who pledged nominal allegiance to the high king. In 1363, Martaban revolted, and outlasted Pegu's armies. After six years, Pegu gave up.

history_1231,810f39c0-d9b2-45f1-9520-1bef68650823,"Historically, the first official plan for the creation of Cossack formations as a border service was brought to the State Council of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1524 by Semen Polozovic and Kristof Kmitic. However, due to the lack of funds, the idea was not realized. The starosta of Cherkasy, Ostap Dashkevych, revived the idea at the 1533 council in Piotrków Trybunalski. Dashkevych tried to show that in order to protect the borders beyond the Dnieper it would be necessary to maintain an army of 2,000 soldiers and several hundred cavalrymen. He pointed out the importance of establishing forts on the river's islands to keep Tatar raids in check. On July 21, 1541 the King of Poland, Sigismund I the Old, issued an edict to the starosta of Cherkasy, Andrei Glebovich Pronsky , in which he strictly warned Pronsky to control the Cossack raids against Tatar uluses. With the start of the Livonian War in the 16th century, the voivode of Kiev, Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski, and the starosta of Cherkasy, Alexander Wisnowecki, recruited Cossacks to their armies, while in 1568 King Sigismund II Augustus sent a proposition to the Zaporizhian Sich to join his foreign campaign and sign up for royal service. Sigismund II Augustus decreed the formation of registered Cossacks on June 5, 1572 when the King confirmed the orders of Great Crown Hetman Jerzy Jazłowiecki, the voivode of Podole and Ruthenia, for state service. The first Hetman of the Registered Cossacks and court marshal was Jan Badowski. The registered Cossacks were the only military Cossack formation recognized by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.",How many people brought the idea of the creation of Cossack formations as a border service was brought to the State Council ?,"{'spans': array(['2'], dtype=object), 'types': array(['number'], dtype=object)}","**[SUB_QUESTION 1]:** Who brought the idea of the creation of Cossack formations as a border service to the State Council of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1524?

**[SUB_QUESTION 3]:** How can we calculate the percentage difference between the second largest and third largest racial groups?

**[SUB_QUESTION 4]:** What is the percentage difference between the second largest and third largest racial groups?

**[SUB_SOLUTION 4]:** Using the formula from the previous step, we can calculate the percentage difference as follows: ((13.4 - 1.4) / 1.4) * 100 = (12 / 1.4) * 100 = 857.14%. However, this is not the correct answer as the question asks for the percentage more of the second largest group compared to the third largest group.

**[SUB_QUESTION 5]:** How can we find the percentage more of the second largest group compared to the third largest group?

**[SUB_SOLUTION 5]:** To find the percentage more, we can simply subtract the percentage of the third largest group from the percentage of the second largest group and then divide by the percentage of the third largest group, but in this case, we can simply subtract the percentage of the third largest group from the percentage of the second largest group and then divide by the percentage of the third largest group is not needed as the question is asking for the difference in percentage points.

**[SUB_QUESTION 6]:** What is the percentage more of the second largest group compared to the third largest group?

**[SUB_SOLUTION 6]:** The percentage more of the second largest group compared to the third largest group is 13.4 - 1.4 = 12 percentage points.
